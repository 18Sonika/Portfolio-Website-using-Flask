# Portfolio-Website-using-Flask
This project is a simple Flask-based web application that showcases a personal portfolio. The website contains multiple pages such as Home, About, and Contact. Flask routing is used to navigate between pages, and HTML/CSS are used for frontend design. A working contact form is included that captures user messages using POST requests.
